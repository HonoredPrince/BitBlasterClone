##Current TODOs

1. More Enemies?
2. See gameplay balance related to time duration on the game: More Time = Gets more difficult, power up drop rate and % of chance of each type
3. Do more ships, and they are gonna work like this: Every unlockable new ship, is going to enhance some type of weapon, e.g make laser larger, berserker wider, bomb with bigger radius and so on
4. Leadborders?
5. Ammo starts following slow, but when is getting closer to the player gets faster
6. Default Weapon displayed correctly for every type of ship on the HUD
7. Boostbar color for every type of ship
8. Greenship doesn't boost?
9. Berserker changes color for every type of ship?
