## Current TODOs

1. More Enemies?
2. See gameplay balance related to time duration on the game: More Time = Gets more difficult, power up drop rate and % of chance of each type
3. Do more ships, and they are gonna work like this: Every unlockable new ship, is going to change the default bullet, and minor upgrades accordingly to the archetype of the ship
4. Leadborders?
5. Ammo starts following slow, but when is getting closer to the player gets faster
7. Boostbar color for every type of ship
8. Greenship doesn't boost?
