##Current TODOs

1. More Enemies?
2. See gameplay balance related to time duration on the game: More Time = Gets more difficult, power up drop rate and % of chance of each type
3. Do more ships, and they are gonna work like this: Every unlockable new ship, is going to enhance some type of weapon, e.g make laser larger, berserker wider, bomb with bigger radius and so on
4. Do Highscore, Format: Points, Time, TypeOfShip?
5. Leadborders?
